- Users needing a visual interface for SLEAP workflows

## Features
- Interactive video playback with pose overlay
- Model configuration and training interface
- Batch processing capabilities
- Export tools for analysis results
- Integration with existing SLEAP pipelines

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- SLEAP framework
- GUI dependencies (tkinter/PyQt)
- Video processing libraries
