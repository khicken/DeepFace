# DeepFace

This is a directory to two software tools used in ["DeepFace: A High-Precision and Scalable Deep Learning Pipeline for Predicting Large-Scale Brain Activity from Facial Dynamics in Mice"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40661434/).


## [`mediaGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/mediaGUI)
Use this tool to preprocess gigabytes of facial video data to a single concatenated video, which is used to train DeepFace.

**Please see [mediaGUI](https://github.com/khicken/mediaGUI) for installation instructions.**

## [`sleapGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/sleapGUI)
This tool incorporates the optimized parameter combination specifically identified for large scale facial video analysis, enabling accurate and efficient large-scale orofacial data processing beyond the default SLEAP GUI.

**Please see [sleapGUI](https://github.com/khicken/sleapGUI) for installation instructions.**
