## [`mediaGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/mediaGUI)
Use this tool to preprocess gigabytes of facial video data to a single concatenated video, which is used to train DeepFace.

**Please see [mediaGUI](https://github.com/khicken/mediaGUI) for installation instructions.**

## [`sleapGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/sleapGUI)
This tool incorporates the optimized parameter combination specifically identified for large scale facial video analysis, enabling accurate and efficient large-scale orofacial data processing beyond the default SLEAP GUI.

**Please see [sleapGUI](https://github.com/khicken/sleapGUI) for installation instructions.**


## Usage Demo
\[currently making tutorial video on how to use DeepFace pipeline\]

## Troubleshoot
If you have a technical question with either [`mediaGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/mediaGUI) or [`sleapGUI`](https://github.com/khicken/sleapGUI), then feel free to request a "New Issue" in the "Issues" section for the respective GUI.
